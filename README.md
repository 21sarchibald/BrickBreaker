## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] I think it would be fun to add levels to the game so the game gets progressively more difficult.
* [ ] It would be cool to keep a running total of the bricks destroyed and then store the user's high score.
* [ ] I would like it if there was an incentive to finish the levels quickly. Maybe there could be a timer, and if the user finishes the level faster, they get more bonus points.
